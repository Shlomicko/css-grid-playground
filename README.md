# CSS Grid Playground

This is a set of simple CSS Grid examples I ([Bill Odom][1]) originally
created for a talk called "CSS Grid: Get ready to fall in love" at the
2018 [Craft Conference][2] (although I've added a few things since
then). You can find the latest version here:

> [CSS Grid Playground on GitHub][3]

If you'd like to try the application without installing it locally, you
can run it entirely within your browser via StackBlitz:

> [CSS Grid Playground on StackBlitz][4]

Note: While the examples are hosted in an [Angular][5] app that uses
[Sass][6], that's just to make some things easier to build or
demonstrate. None of the CSS Grid concepts are specific to Angular or
Sass.
